This bug occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links.  If the app is launched from a deep link that includes a query parameter with a value containing a reserved URL character (like a space or a plus sign), the `Linking.getInitialURL()` method may return `null`, preventing the app from properly handling the link.  This is inconsistent with how browsers handle URLs and can lead to unexpected behavior.
